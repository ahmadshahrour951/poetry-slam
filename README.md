This assignments is an introduction to how to read into files and make something useful out of it, and in this case we're printing out each element! exiciting! so lets get to it. There are four helper functions:

1. get_file_lines(), which essentially reads into a file and creates an array of elements of each of line from the file.
2. lines_printed_backwards(), this prints each line of the list given but backwards...
3. lines_printed_random(), will print random elements of the list given.
4. lines_printed_custom(), will print the list given based on the loops given. It performs a cyclic function of printing per se.
